The LASER Institute curriculum is modular by design and consists of instructional modules that can be assembled into multiple distinct semester-long courses, incorporated into existing courses, or used individually for workshops, webinars, or other learning experiences. This design enables instructors to tailor content and activities for learners with different disciplinary backgrounds and to incorporate them as needed into new or existing programs, thereby expanding high-quality educational opportunities in LA for institutions that lack the resources to create these materials from scratch.

## Design Principles

The guiding design principle of the LASER BEAM curriculum, setting it apart from existing programs in learning analytics and educational data science, is a close connection between exemplary STEM education research and hands-on experience analyzing real-world datasets. This connection is essential for building the competencies necessary to carry out high-quality education research in STEM fields and to enable researchers to integrate methodological strategies and practices with theoretical and practical issues in STEM education. Guiding design principles the LASER curriculum include:

1.  **Research Connections**. A close connection between exemplary STEM education research and hands-on experience analyzing real-world datasets.

2.  **Scaffolded Activities**. Carefully scaffolded activities designed to ease learners into the conceptual and technical aspects and gradually release instructor support.

3.  **Hands-On Programming**. Experience using modern, industry standard analytic tools like R and Python to carry out essential data science workflow processes.

4.  **Real-World Data**. Use of real-world datasets from a wide range of sources such as MOOCs, student information systems, and log data from digital learning platforms.

5.  **Topic Deep Dives**. Opportunities for participants to explore key topics in-depth through Essential Readings and coding Case Studies.

6.  **Lowered Barriers**. Activities are designed to lower the barriers faced by researchers with little programming experience or research backgrounds in advanced methods.

7.  **Empower** **Researcher Identity**. Scholar agency in connecting instruction to practice, selecting and shaping their data, and developing social and professional identities as learning analytics researchers.
